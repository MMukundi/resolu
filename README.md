# Résolu
###### *(adv. FR) Solved, or resolved*

## A Rusty computer algebra system

Leveraging Rust's advanced type system, Résolu hopes to make mathematical equations (
Operations, conversions, and more), feel at home in the Rust ecosystem, 
 making it easier to manipulate and solve expressions and equations.

## Why?

One of Rust's greatest superpowers is its
insanely powerful yet ergonomic type system.
By encoding system state in the type system,
you can write code that the compiler helps you write, which feels like magic!

By applying these principles to a computer algebra, 
you can write equations and theorems in the way that feels most natural to you, Rust can
guide you through verifying the expressions you write abide by the axioms of your expressions, both of which *you* can define.
